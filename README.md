# cmdUtils

This is just a repo for me to store my cmdutils

## ball.sh

This is just a simple bash script that displays a "ball" bouncing horizontally across the screen. You can use the `-h` flag to get a few more options

## Bruteforce serverfolders

Ignore the rust version. I didn't build it.
But the python version works.

This script tries to figure out the urls of existing folders on a server with brute force. You have to specify an url in the format of `https://www.google.com/`. Use the `-h` flag to view all the possible options.

## Color Snitch

This script runs and color the output of [snitch](https://github.com/tsoding/snitch). You can either pipe the output of `snitch list` to `colorSnitch` or you can use the `-r` flag to run it directly. Use the `-h` flag to view all the possible options. A binary release can be found under [releases](https://github.com/EldosHD/cmdUtils/releases).
